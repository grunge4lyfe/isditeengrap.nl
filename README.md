# isditeengrap.nl

A simple web application that determines whether this is a joke or not.

### Getting Started

You can run the application locally by cloning this repository and running the following commands:
```sh
cd isditeengrap.nl/
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will run the application on port 3030 by default. You should be able to access it by navigating to http://localhost:3030.

You can optionally change the port number by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and changing the `PORT` environment variable.
